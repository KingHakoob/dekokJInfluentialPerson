                <p id="influenceText">On February 23rd, 2003, there was a fire, like a really bad fire (It
                    was a very hot fire), at 25.0000° N, 71.0000° W. I was only 2 at the time, and despite
                    what you might think, I couldn't swim. It was just me, my $25 million yacht, my 35 personal
                    assitants, and the sea. The fire started on the top deck, which makes sense because
                    heat rises, but our hero Elizar was completely unaware of what was going on. He was only
                    13 years old, but he already possessed incredible strength, speed, the ability to fly, and
                    the incredible mind power to read and control minds. For Elizar this was a dream come true,
                    after all his favorite superheros were Professor X and Superman. If you ask me, it was by
                    chance that he heard the minds of my 35 personal assitants. As soon as he realized what was
                    happening he flew as fast as he could to the yacht, took a deep breath, and he blew the fire
                    out. That day not only did he save our lives, he saved me $25 million for another yacht.
